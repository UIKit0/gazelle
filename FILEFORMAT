This is a description of Gazelle's bytecode file format.

The file format itself is "Bitcode," a generic bytecode format
developed as part of the LLVM project.  It is documented here:
  http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/docs/BitCodeFormat.html

This file describes the meaning of the information that Gazelle
puts into the bytecode.

Bitcode file, application magic number = "GH"
All offsets are 0-based.

STRINGS -- all strings are put into the STRINGS block, and referenced
           by offset in other parts of the file
  [STRING, <ascii array of chars>]
  [STRING, <ascii array of chars>]
  ...

INTFAS -- the list of all IntFAs (lexing DFAs)
  INTFA -- a single DFA
    [INTFA_STATE, # of transitions]  <-- first state is assumed to be start state
    [INTFA_STATE, # of transitions]
    [INTFA_FINAL_STATE, # of transitions, terminal_name_int]
    ...
    (states are identified by their offset in this list)

    [INTFA_TRANSITION, edge val, dest state offset]
    [INTFA_TRANSITION_RANGE, edge val low, edge val high, dest state offset]
    ...
    (transitions are identified by their offset in this list)

RTNS -- a list of all the RTNs
  RTN - a single RTN
    [RTN_INFO, nonterm_name_int, # of slots]

    [RTN_IGNORE, terminal_name_int]
    ...

    [RTN_STATE, # of transitions+decisions, intfa #, is final]
    [RTN_STATE, # of transitions+decisions, intfa #, is final]
    ...

    [RTN_TRANSITION_TERMINAL, terminal_name_int, dest RTN state offset, slotname_int, slotnum]
    [RTN_TRANSITION_NONTERM, rtn_offset, dest RTN state offset, slotname_int, slotnum]
    [RTN_DECISION, terminal_name_int, <array of transition offsets>]
    ...
