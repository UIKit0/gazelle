Gries, David:  Describing an Algorithm by Hopcroft, 1972
   Acta Informatica, 2(2):97-109

   This article is a bit more digestible presentation of Hopcroft's algorithm.
   It was useful in actually implementing the minimization algorithm in minimize.lua.


Hopcroft, John E.  An n log n algorithm for minimizing states in a finite automaton, 1971
   Available online at: ftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/71/190/CS-TR-71-190.pdf

   This algorithm, published in 1971, is still the best known algorithm for DFA
   minimization.  It is O(n log n), where all other algorithms are at least O(n^2).
   I use this algorithm in minimize.lua.


Scott, Michael L.  Programming Language Pragmatics, second edition, 2006

   This is a textbook about programming language implementation and design.
   I used its NFA construction in nfa_construct.lua.
